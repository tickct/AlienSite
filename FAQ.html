            <div class="title">Frequently Asked Questions</div><br/>

            <div class="question"><b>How much notice do you need for an event?</b><br/><br/>
                A minimum of 2 weeks notice is required to request an event. 
                It is strongly recommended that you contact us even earlier, since we prioritize
                event requests on a first come, first serve basis.</div>
            <div class="question"><b> Can you do events off campus?</b><br/><br/>
                No. Due to IIT's insurance policy, we are not allowed to do events off campus.
                We also can not purchase additional insurance for legal reasons, this has been looked into in the past.</div>
            <div class="question"><b>I have heard conflicting information about whether or not you charge. How much does it cost to do our event?</b><br/><br/>
                Nothing is charged directly to your organization. In the past we charged your organization for our services,
                and in turn you would ask for funding through the Student Activity Fund.
                While this was a more "fair" way of funding Alien (since the amount of funding we received was directly proportionate
                to the events we helped with), it was also confusing to some people. We are now directly funded through the SAF so that it
                is easier for you and so that there are no direct charges to your organization.</div>
            <div class="question"><b>I requested an event, but I haven't heard back from you. How do I know what the status is?</b><br /><br/>
                We are sorry that we haven't gotten back to you yet. Because our members are volunteers, 
                it can sometimes be hard to work out the logistics of your event. We will generally try to give you at least one week's
                notice if we can't do an event, we can't promise much more than that. To check to see what the status is, feel free to email alien@iit.edu.</div>
            <div class="question"><b>You responded back saying that you can't do my event. What other options do we have?</b> <br/><br/>
                Event Services may be able to help with your events (although there may be a charge for their help).
                You can email them at events@iit.edu. If for some reason they are unable to accommodate you, 
                feel free to ask us for recommendations of companies in the area that might be able to meet you needs. 
                Our staff has a good working relationship with many AV companies in the Chicagoland area, and 
                chances are we know someone who would be perfect for your event!</div>
            <div class="question"><b>Can I or my student organization borrow Alien's equipment if your staff isn't available?</b><br/><br/>
                NO. Per the Judicial Board decision on case number 20130301A, our equipment may only operated by trained students.
                If you are interested in joining us and being trained on our equipment so that you might be able to run our equipment 
                for your organization in the future, feel free to email us at alien@iit.edu.</div>
            <div class="question"><b>What is required to join Alien?</b><br/><br/>
                To become an official member, please email alien@iit.edu to express interest in joining us.
                The requirement for being an Alien member is that you work a minimum of 3 events with our trained staff. 
                During these events you will be trained on our equipment. The more you work with us, the more equipment you will be 
                allowed to use.</div>
            <div class="question"><b>Can I send an event request by email?</b><br/><br/>
                Please do not send event requests by email. You can request on web portal: http://iit.edu/~alien/request. 
                If for some reason you can't submit via our web portal (browser incompatibility, site is down, etc), you may send us a request by email as long as you specify why it is being sent via email. Any requests received via email will not be official unless a valid reason for not submitting on the web-portal is given. If you do need to send a request by email, please include the following information:<br/>
                > Name of your student organization<br/>
                > Your name<br/>
                > Your email address<br/>
                > Your phone number<br/>
                > The date(s) of your event<br/>
                > The start and approx. end time of your event<br/>
                > Description of the event<br/>
                > Summary of what you are looking for from us<br/>
                > The location of the event <br/></div>
